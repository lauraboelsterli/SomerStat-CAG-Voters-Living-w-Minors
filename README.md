how many parents vote in somerville? 

In the past three elections (local, state, and federal), parents have accounted for between 15-25% of Somerville voters (with higher proportions in local elections). A tentative conclusion is that parents are more likely than non-parents to vote in general, and definitely more likely than non-parents to vote in local elections. However, even with the higher likelihood of voting, they are still a minority of the voting population because they are a small minority of the resident population
