how many parents vote in somerville? 

We've discovered a number of issues with the data that actually make this really hard to estimate, so we've got some estimates of estimates here that will hopefully be sufficient. If they are not, we can get more precise with some more extensive data from the Elections team, but I think the overall answer is that parents are both more likely to vote than nonparents and still a relatively small proportion of the voters.

Some context: about 12% of households in Somerville have a child under 18 (according to the 5-year 2023 American Communities Survey). This is not directly linkable to percent of people who are parents (and also not all households have people who are eligible to vote), but it gives context to the following voting information.
 
In the past three elections (local, state, and federal), parents have accounted for between 15-25% of Somerville voters (with higher proportions in local elections). A tentative conclusion is that parents are more likely than non-parents to vote in general, and definitely more likely than non-parents to vote in local elections. However, even with the higher likelihood of voting, they are still a minority of the voting population because they are a small minority of the resident population.  

For CAG purposes, if all the parents who come to the polls do vote for a debt exclusion, that's going to be around 25% of voters, so they still need to get at least a third of the remaining voters to vote for the debt exclusion as well to get over 50%. 

There is definitely also room to grow the people who come to polls (i.e. convince people to vote who would not otherwise vote), which I assume is the second part of the question (what proportion of parents vote). Local elections have lower turnout both among parents and nonparents (though nonparents turnout drops a lot more than parents), so a reliable way to increase turnout in general is to hold the exclusion vote in a state or presidential election year.
